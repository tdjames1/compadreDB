\title{A function to calculate the timing of lifetime reproductive events.}
\usage{
lifeTimeRepEvents(matU, matF, matC = F, startLife = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{matU}{A matrix containing only survival-dependent processes ( growth,
stasis, shrinkage).}

\item{matF}{A matrix containing only sexual reproduction, with zeros
elsewhere.}

\item{matC}{A matrix containing only clonal reproduction, with zeros
elsewhere.}

\item{startLife}{The first stage at which the author consider the beginning
of life.}
}
\value{
This function applies Markov chain approaches to decompose various
moments of along the age-based reproduction of individuals in a matrix
population model. When both a 'matF' and a 'matC' are provided, the
following outputs are calculated for both independently, and these are
differentiated with the suffix "Fec" or "Clo", respectively:

- 'p': probability of achiving maturity, sexual or clonal.

- 'La': mean age at maturity (in the same units as the matrix population
model).

- 'meanLifeExpectancy': mean life expectancy conditional on entering the
life cycle in the first reproductive stage

- 'remainingMatureLifeExpectancy': Life expectancy from mean maturity. This
is mean life expectancy - mean age at maturity ('La' above). This value can
be negative because both mean life expectancy and mean age at maturity are
means of their respective distributions.
