\title{A function to calculate measures of longevity.}
\usage{
longevity(matU, startLife = 1, initPop = 100, run = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{matU}{A matrix containing only survival-dependent processes (growth,
stasis, shrinkage).}

\item{startLife}{The first stage at which the author consider the beginning
of life.}

\item{initPop}{Initial population size.}

\item{run}{Number of iterations that the maximum longevity will be
calculated for.}
}
\value{
This function applies Markov chain approaches to obtain mean life
expectancy, and a loop to calculate maximum longevity. Outputs are:

- 'eta': mean life expectancy conditional on entering the life cycle on life
stage described by 'startLife'.

- 'Max': maximum longevity observed by iterating a population vector with
'initPop' individuals in stage 'startLife' up to 'run' times.
}
